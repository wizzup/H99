# Scraping script

This directory contain python script for scraping problem set from [haskellwiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

## usage

```
python fetchProblems.py
```

output files is generated in `out` directory.

**Note**: Choosing Python instead of Haskell because I found it is hard to get the next slibling node using scaple.
